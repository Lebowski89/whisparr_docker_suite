whisparr_toggles_enable_nfs_autofs: true

  ## Toggle whether to create an NFS docker volume to pass to the container. In my case, I pass through my media storage to use as a root folder

  ## By default, the role includes the option of setting up an SFTP rclone docker volume to attach to the container
  ## This is useful if you want your download client on a remote server with the download folder mounted locally via the rclone volume
  ## You then configure the 'Remote Path Mappings' within the arr apps to line-up the remote and local paths
  ## By default, metrics and rclone webui are setup along with the plugin - enabling simple monitoring via the webui and more advanced monitoring with prometheus/grafana

whisparr_toggles_enable_rclone: true

  ## Note: If you do wish to have a remote download client set-up, you will want to use 'Unpackerr' on the remote server alongside your download client
  ## Unpackerr will make sure any archived downloads are fully extracted before lidarr tries importing. Without this, incomplete files will be marked as successfully imported

  ## Those wanting to mount a gdrive, or some other cloud storage type, will need to make changes to the rclone defaults/tasks/vars depending on your needs, set-up, use-case.
